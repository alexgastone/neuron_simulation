The following mechanisms are included:
- `etms.mod`: implementation of short term plasticity (STP), v2 (used)
- `tms.mod` : custom-made implementation of STP, v1
- `fdsexp2s.mod` : implementation of STP as described in Nelson et al 1997 (using double exponential Exp2Syn)
- `fdsexpsn.mod`: implementation of STP as described in Nelson et al 1997 (using single exponential ExpSyn)
- `fdsintf.mod` : implementation of STP as described in Nelson et al 1997 (with added functions for plotting)
- `Gluct.mod` : fluctuating conductance model (Destexhe et al, 1999)
- `vecevent.mod` : vector stream of events
