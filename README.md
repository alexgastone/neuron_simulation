**Cortical spiking is determined by the synergy of synchrony, synaptic strength, and short-term plasticity.**

# Goal
- share the project simulations and results
- provide Py package so users can also run simulations and analyses

# Current status
- added `Dockerfile` and `.yaml` file: users can build image and start containers based on that image (avoids compatibility issues between the NEURON simulation library and Python libraries)
